## Project Description
The goal of the project is to carry out an end-to-end analysis of a dataset with the focus on statistical analysis and on the visualisation and presentation of results.  

This project will analyse relationships between the collective self-esteem of a country (extrapolated form the sample offered in the dataset) and the dimensions of national culture power distance and individualism through statistical test and methods. 
 As a bonus, there is the challenge to find the relation between self-esteem and the collective perception of narcissistic behaviour in a country.

## Hypotheses / Questions
What are the questions you would like to answer with your project? Write your hypotheses here.

The hypothesis the project will revolve around how the collective perception of self-esteem in a country differs depending on different dimensions of national culture.
The culutral factors reasearched were Power distance and individualistic vs. collectivist societies. 

As an added bonus, the dristributions of results by gender were compared to see if it was worth expanding. Equally, the sample mean grouped by age was plotted to analyse any trends between age and self-esteem.

## Dataset

The main hypothesis created bases on the data retrieved from a questionnaire for the self-evaluation of an individual’s self-esteem, developed by Rosenberg in the 60s. The dataset used collected 47,974 answers in total and includes not only the overall score for each participant, but the age and nationality of each. 

As a secondary dataset, Hofstede’s cultural compass report was used. This report analyses 6 dimensions of national culture of different countries; power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation and indulgence. 

Both files where in form of a .csv and where edited directly usign python.pandas and sql.
